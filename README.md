About this course: Ever wonder how Netflix decides what movies to recommend for you? Or how Amazon recommends books? We can get a feel for how it works by building a simplified recommender of our own!

<b>On this website, I recommend movies based on the similarity of ratings the user gave and those of professional raters gave on IDMB, which is to say, you are more likely to share taste with the raters who rate movies like you do. Then what movies to be recommeded are those the similar raters think very highly of.</b>

<P></P>

And These are the steps:
<P></P>

1. Read in and parse data into lists and maps;
2. Calculate average ratings;
3. Calculate how similar a given rater is to another user based on ratings; 
4. Recommend movies to a given user based on ratings;
5. Display recommended movies for a given user on a webpage.
